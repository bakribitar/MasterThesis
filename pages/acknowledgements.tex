I want to dedicate this work to the source of every inspiration and support in my life, my mother. She was the reason, why I decided on the project idea.

I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Dr. Uwe Baumgarten for his useful comments, remarks and guidance during this work. 

I would like to thank my beloved ones, my sisters, who stood beside me. I will always be grateful for having you.

Very special thanks to my dear friend, Hasan, the one who gave the first motivation and useful ideas in planning this project.
